a) The equivalent of a product owner in a non-agile project is an on-site customer. Another equiavlent role is a business analyst that specialized in gathering product requirements. The role of a product 
   owner is to manage the product backlog. One of the central responsibilites of a product owner is to maximize the value of the product that results from the scrum team's efforts. The product owner also   
   develops the stories in the product backlog to reflect project goals, communicates project goals, and makes sure that the product backlog is transparent and visible.
b) The role of a scrum master is to help members of a team understand and practice the theory of Scrum. More responsibilites include coaching teams and group, helping leaders come to conclusions on their own,
   and improve the team so that the team works together to create value on an ongoing basis. A scum master differs from a prodct owner in the sense that the product owner is responsible only for the product 
   and the story items in the product backlog. Whereas, a scrum master interacts with the whole team to ensure that the team works effectively to create value and delivers the product on time.
